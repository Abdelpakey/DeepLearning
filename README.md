# DeepLearning

This repository keeps track of my awesome adventure trying to know a little more about deep learning (mainly with TensorFlow \o/ )

## What do we have here?

* Links to my personal projects while learning Deep Learning and Tensorflow
* Links for online resources about Deep Learning and TensorFlow
