# DeepLearning

This repository keeps track of my awesome adventure trying to know a little more about deep learning (mainly with TensorFlow \o/ )

## What do we have here?

* In this README file, you'll find some links (and hopefully tips) with instructions of how to learn more about deep learning and TensorFlow

* In the /study folder you'll find small activities and source code, with the instructions link in a README, that can be useful

* Also, I plan to make some personal projects using TensorFlow, and maybe I'll put in this repository or create a new one for the projects (we'll see)
